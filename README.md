# Jacques Machine

(a work in progress, no point in cloning or forking at this point)

Jacques Machine relies on [Naturalingo](http://github.com/etdebruin/Naturalingo).

## Getting Started

Take a look at the command line options:

  ./bin/jacques-machine -h

At this point there is a terminal and [Campfire chat](http://campfirenow.com/) interface both which are detailed
in the help.

## For Developers

(but mainly so I can remember)

Inside 'jacques-machine'

	gem build jacques-machine.gemspec

With the resulting .gem file, do

	gem install jacques-machine-0.0.x.gem

## Thank you's

I have to thank [Alex Reisner](http://github.com/alexreisner) whom I met at RubyConf '11.  His elegant '[geocoder](http://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder)' served as wonderful reading material as I got my basic framework layed out.

Thanks be to [Matt Aimonetti](http://github.com/mattetti) for constantly rewriting my code but more importantly his willingness to do so :)

[Rob Kaufman](http://github.com/notch8) is walking reference manual.  On *anything*.
